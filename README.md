# tictactoe-game
This project is a classic implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to mark X and O on a 3x3 grid. The game detects winning conditions (three marks in a row, column, or diagonal) and declares a winner or a draw when all squares are filled.
